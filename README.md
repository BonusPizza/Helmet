The Helmet 3D prints are mostly ready. I'm currently working on developing a reliable power source and preparing everything to create my own soldered circuit board for all the hardware. 

## Parts
* ESP32-Wroom-D32 DevKit
* 2 MG90s Servos
* 3,7 Lipo Battery
* 2 Step-Up-Converter (3,3V and 5V)
* USB-C Charge Module
* DIY LED Lights (light blue)
* Button(s)

## Future
Build a voice recognition for the helmet and add commands for certain functionalities, e.g. opening the visor, or controlling the eye LEDs.
