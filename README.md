The Helmet 3D prints are ready and the Servos and LED-Lights are build in. Iâ€™m currently waiting for a friend who is designing a custom circuit board using my schematic.

## Parts
* ESP32-Wroom-D32 DevKit
* 2 MG90s Servos
* 3,7 Lipo Battery
* 2 Step-Up-Converter (3,3V and 5V)
* USB-C Charge Module

## Status LED
| Errorcode | Status Led       | Meaning |
|:----------|:----------------:|:--------------------------------------------------|

| 2 | wip | The visor is already closed |

## Future
I am currently building a voice recognition for the helmet functionalities, e.g. opening the visor, or controlling the eye LEDs. 
Look in the voice-recognition [Branch](https://github.com/BonusPizza/Helmet/tree/voice-recognition) for further infos.
